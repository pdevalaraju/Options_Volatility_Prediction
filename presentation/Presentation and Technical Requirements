Presentation Requirements
The presentation requirements for the project are as follows.
Your presentation must:

[ ] Be at least 8 to 10 minutes long (check with the instructor for the official presentation time).
[ ] Describe the core message or hypothesis for your project.
[ ] Describe the predictive model chose and why this model was chosen.
[ ] Describe the data preparation and model training process.
[ ] Describe the techniques used to evaluate the model performance.
[ ] Summarize your conclusions and predictions. This should include a numerical summary (what data your model yielded), as well as visualizations of that summary (plots of the final model evaluation and predictions).
[ ] Discuss the implications of your findings. This is where you get to have an open-ended discussion about what your findings mean.
 
 
Technical Requirements

The technical requirements for Project 2 are as follows.
[ ] Create a Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab Notebook, or Amazon SageMaker Notebook to prepare a training and testing dataset.
[ ] Optionally, apply a dimensionality reduction technique to reduce the input features, or perform feature engineering to generate new features to train the model.
[ ] Create one or more machine learning models.
[ ] Fit the model(s) to the training data.
[ ] Evaluate the trained model(s) using testing data. Include any calculations, metrics, or visualizations needed to evaluate the performance.
[ ] Show the predictions using a sample of new data. Compare the predictions if more than one model is used.
[ ] Save PNG images of your visualizations to distribute to the class and instructional team and for inclusion in your presentation and your repo's README.md file.
[ ] Use one new machine learning library, machine learning model, or evaluation metric that hasn't been covered in class.
[ ] Create a README.md in your repo with a write-up summarizing your project. Be sure to include any usage instructions to set up and use the model.
